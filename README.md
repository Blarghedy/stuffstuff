stuffstuff
==========

A Minecraft mod lacking a descriptive name, with various unrelated standalone items in addition to integrating with various well known Minecraft mods, including BuildCraft, Thermal Expansion, Industrial Craft 2, Universal Electricity, Equivalent Exchange 3, and Applied Energistics 2.

The AE Stuff mod will be an AE2 addon.  So far I've completed a few fun things, namely some variants of (entirely aesthetic) fluix bricks.  I plan to work on the AE Stuff mod much more now that AE2 is in closed alpha.

The Plaid Stuff mod is more or less complete.  Its largest feature is, in a way, pretty much its ownly feature: the Plaid Plains biome, which consists of plaid grass, plaid water, plaid trees, plaid tall grass, etc.  Eventually I might add some mobs to the biome, but for now the normal mob pool spawns in it.

The Stuff Stuff mod is both its own sub-mod and the overall group of four mods.  The sub mod is the core, and will end up with items and blocks that don't fit into the other mods.  Ideally, this will be a non-themed mod much like Extra Utilities, although that mostly depends on whatever else I come up with to add to it.  So far, it has a few EE2-inspired items, one of which is, more or less, an advanced mercurial eye.  Some of the core classes of the mod include some easily extensible versions of vanilla blocks, specifically stairs, slabs, and doors.  These classes make it easy to add mod versions of stairs, slabs, and doors.  For example, AE Stuff's bricks are all in stair, slab, and door form as well.

Finally, the Vanilla Stuff mod, for now, consists entirely of stairs, slabs, and doors made of vanilla blocks.  So far, there are log, iron ore, diamond block, redstone block, lava, and water versions of at least some of these.  Redstone block slabs and stairs act like redstone blocks, and lava blocks will catch nearby things on fire much like lava does.  A fun thing to do is ride a boat up a set of water stairs.

In addition to all of these, I plan to have more practical versions of Equivalent Exchange 2 tools and integration with the various power mods.

The first official release of this mod will be for MC 1.7.2 (or even 1.8, possibly), as Forge for 1.7.2 seems to be coming along nicely and 1.8 looks like it will be here soon.
