==========

A Minecraft mod lacking a descriptive name, with various unrelated standalone items in addition to (eventually) integrating with various well known Minecraft mods, including BuildCraft, Thermal Expansion, Industrial Craft 2, Universal Electricity, Equivalent Exchange 3, and Applied Energistics.

Initially planned are a few items inspired by some of my favorite features of Equivalent Exchange 2, powered by the various power mods, in addition to a few rough ideas for Applied Energistics integration.  

The first official release of this mod will probably be for MC 1.7.2, as Forge for that seems to be coming along nicely and I don't see myself getting much done before Forge happens.
